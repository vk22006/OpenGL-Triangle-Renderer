# Modern OpenGL Showcase

A structured, milestone-driven journey through modern OpenGL development.

This repository documents my progressive learning and implementation of real-time rendering techniques using modern OpenGL. Each major milestone is tagged to reflect significant conceptual and technical improvements.

---

## Purpose

- Develop a strong foundation in modern OpenGL
- Implement core and advanced real-time rendering techniques
- Track growth through versioned milestones
- Serve as a portfolio-ready showcase of graphics programming skills

> Note: A separate repository will focus on custom engine development.  
> This project is dedicated purely to OpenGL progression.

## 🧱 Project Structure

Each milestone builds upon the previous one. Tags are used to mark significant achievements.

Example progression:

- Basic window & context creation
- Rendering a triangle
- Shaders (vertex & fragment)
- And others..(in progress)
